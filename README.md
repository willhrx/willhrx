- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @willhrx what's up! I'm a recent maths grad working on a few projects from my laptop as I take some time to travel and see the world.
- I've been playing around with a few syntaxes for some time now and I must say my favorites are Python, since it's just an absolute beast, and Solidity simply
- becasue it's so similar to javascript and I find the whole smart contract world really exciting!
- If you wanna chat you can reach me on twitter @willhrx or discord willhrx#4210
